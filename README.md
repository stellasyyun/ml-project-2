# ðŸŽµ Seasonal Hit Song Analysis

## Analysis Overview
This analysis explores how song characteristics (BPM, energy) and success vary by season, using the Spotify dataset to uncover patterns in hit songs.

## Key Findings

### 1. Seasonal Success Patterns
- **Summer (Jun-Aug)**
  - BPM: 120-140
  - Energy: 0.7-0.8
  - Best Genres: Dance/Pop
  - Example: "One Dance" by Drake

- **Winter (Dec-Feb)**
  - BPM: 80-120
  - Energy: 0.5-0.6
  - Best Genres: Acoustic/Ballads
  - Example: "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran

### 2. Statistical Evidence
```python
# ANOVA Results
BPM Seasonal Variation: F(3, 1246) = 28.43, p < 0.001
Energy Seasonal Variation: F(3, 1246) = 32.17, p < 0.001
```

### 3. Genre Performance
- Dance/Electronic: Summer peak (+25%)
- Acoustic: Winter peak (+20%)
- Pop: Year-round consistency

## Methodology & Analysis Journey

### 1. Initial Data Analysis (clean_data_analysis.ipynb)
- Set 75th percentile threshold (aligned with Spotify's viral metrics)
- Cleaned and normalized features
- Established baseline success metrics
- Created initial visualizations of popularity distribution

### 2. Feature Analysis (focused_feature_analysis.ipynb)
- Mapped BPM distributions by genre
- Analyzed energy-success correlations
- Created feature importance heatmaps
- Identified genre-specific patterns

### 3. Dance Music Deep-Dive (dance_music_analysis.ipynb)
- Combined 120-160 BPM range analysis
- Studied energy-BPM relationships
- Found optimal dance music patterns
- Visualized success rate distributions

### 4. Seasonal Patterns (seasonal_success_patterns.ipynb)
- Analyzed month-by-month trends
- Created seasonal transition maps
- Identified genre-specific timing
- Generated success rate heatmaps

### 5. Success Recipe Creation (Hit_Recipe_Masters.ipynb)
- Combined all previous findings
- Created genre-specific recipes
- Identified artist adaptation patterns
- Generated final visualization suite

### Statistical Methodology
- ANOVA for seasonal variations
- Chi-square tests for genre success
- Pearson correlations for feature relationships
- Bootstrap validation for patterns
